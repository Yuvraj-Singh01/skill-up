# Skill-up
App for sharing resources to upskill in tech

## Prerequisites


## Set-up and configuration
* Clone repo 
* Create a virtual environment while in project root `py -m venv .venv`

_Important: Good idea to work in a virtual environment to not mess up with python installations or dependencies_

* Activate the virtual environment

  <div align="center">

| OS | How |
| ---- | ----------- |
| Windows | .venv\Scripts\activate |
| Linux/Mac    |source path/to/venv/bin/activate |

  </div>

Use `deactivate` to deactivate the virtual environment anytime

* Navigate to skillup and install dependencies in `requirements.txt` using `cd skillup` then run `pip install -r requirements.txt`

* Server ready to run via `python manage.py runserver`

If `python` doesn't work, try `python3`
